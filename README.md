# Spatio-temporal soil moisture retrieval at the catchment scale using a dense network of cosmic-ray neutron sensors

This repository mainly contains a juypter notebook as well as the required data to reproduce the results of a manuscript submitted to [Hydrology and Earth System Sciences](https://www.hydrology-and-earth-system-sciences.net/). The manuscript is entitled "Spatio-temporal soil moisture retrieval at the catchment scale using a dense network of cosmic-ray neutron sensors" and documents the very first analysis of observations collected by the Cosmic Sense research consortium in a campaign in summer 2019 which features a dense network of CRNS sensors (see [Fersch et al. 2020](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/12/2289/2020/essd-12-2289-2020.html)).

## Content

The jupyter notebook `jfc1-analsis.ipynb` contains the analysis code as well as the code to reproduce the manuscript figures. The directory `data` contains the required data to run the code. A directory `figures` needs to be created where the figures will be stored that are generated by the notebook. The file `jfc1table.csv` contains a set of metadata for the CRNS sensors, the file `calibration_summary.csv` contains some sensor-specific study results.

## Environment

The main dependencies required to run the notebook are `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `wradlib`, and the [cosmicsense](https://github.com/heistermann/cosmicsense) package. We recommend `conda` for dependency management.
